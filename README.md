# Greenfoot-Collector-Game

I programmed this game using *Greenfoot* and Java in order to practice and use fundamental programming concepts.

From Wikipedia:
> Greenfoot is an integrated development environment using Java or Stride designed primarily for educational purposes at the high school and undergraduate level. It allows easy development of two-dimensional graphical applications, such as simulations and interactive games.

This was my first major Java project.
